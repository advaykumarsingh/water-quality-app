            Welcome! Iâ€™m Advay Singh, a high school senior, passionate about machine learning and data science. 
            During my sophomore and junior years, I collaborated with two peers on monthly water quality tests for the Plano Environmental Health & Sustainability department.

            What began as a volunteer opportunity quickly transformed into a powerful learning experience. 
            I was amazed to discover the extensive processes our drinking water undergoes, which fueled my curiosity about its quality and importance. 
            Inspired by this journey, I created this website to provide information to the residents of Plano and raise awareness about our water quality.

            This website aims to inform the residents of Plano about water quality, but I want to emphasize that I am not trying to infringe upon the official Plano water quality website. 
            All data presented here is sourced from Plano City's resources, which you can explore directly for more in-depth information.
